# Store_Database- SQL project
This notebook contains the code implemented for my captone project for the Data analyst in SQL track with Khan Academy.

This database store project contains tables of 5 columns for items sold in a store. I wrote SQL queries to select the kind of data which was needed in the store which I used the select statements to order the items by price which showed at least one statistic about the items.

The goal of this project was to create a store which specializes in at least one type of thing.
